# üîß Template Fixes Applied

## üêõ Issues Found & Fixed

### **Problem:** App Store buttons and footer content not loading

Looking at your screenshot, the main content was working but app store buttons and footer elements were missing. This was caused by **missing template variables** in our data structure.

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Download Section Variable Names** 
**‚ùå BEFORE (incorrect):**
```javascript
DOWNLOADSECTION: {
  TITLE: "DOWNLOAD THE APP", // Wrong case
  subtitle: "Get the full Sonik experience"
}
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (correct):**
```javascript
downloadSection: {
  title: "DOWNLOAD THE APP", // Correct case
  subtitle: "Get the full Sonik experience",
  appStore: "APP STORE", // Added missing button text
  playStore: "GOOGLE PLAY", // Added missing button text
  appStoreAlt: "Download on App Store", // Added missing alt text
  playStoreAlt: "Get it on Google Play" // Added missing alt text
}
```

### **2. Features Section Structure**
**‚ùå BEFORE (incorrect keys):**
```javascript
features: {
  create: { ... },    // Template expects 'discovery'
  upload: { ... },    // Template expects 'secure'  
  share: { ... }      // Template expects 'transparent'
}
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (correct keys):**
```javascript
features: {
  discovery: { 
    title: "CREATE",
    description: "...",
    iconAlt: "Create Icon" // Added missing alt text
  },
  secure: { 
    title: "UPLOAD",
    description: "...",
    iconAlt: "Upload Icon" // Added missing alt text
  },
  transparent: { 
    title: "SHARE",
    description: "...",
    iconAlt: "Share Icon" // Added missing alt text
  }
}
```

### **3. Footer Content Structure**
**‚ùå BEFORE (minimal):**
```javascript
footer: {
  unsubscribeUrl: "...",
  privacyUrl: "...",
  // Missing footer text content
}
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (complete):**
```javascript
footer: {
  emailSentTo: "This email was sent to",
  unsubscribeText: ". If you no longer want to receive these emails, you can",
  unsubscribe: "unsubscribe",
  managePreferences: "manage your preferences"
},
userEmail: email, // Added user email for footer
preferencesUrl: `${config.frontend_url}/preferences?token=${result?.token}` // Added preferences URL
```

## üéØ **Root Cause**

The template was expecting more detailed data structure than what we initially provided. The template had variables like:

- `{{downloadSection.title}}` but we provided `{{DOWNLOADSECTION.TITLE}}`
- `{{downloadSection.appStore}}` but we didn't provide this at all
- `{{features.discovery.title}}` but we provided `{{features.create.title}}`
- `{{footer.emailSentTo}}` but we didn't provide footer text content

## üìß **Impact of Fix**

After applying these fixes, your emails will now properly display:

‚úÖ **App Store buttons** with "APP STORE" and "GOOGLE PLAY" text  
‚úÖ **Download section title** "DOWNLOAD THE APP"  
‚úÖ **Feature descriptions** for CREATE, UPLOAD, SHARE  
‚úÖ **Complete footer** with unsubscribe text and preferences link  
‚úÖ **All icons** with proper alt text for accessibility  

## üöÄ **Implementation in API**

**Yes, this will be automatically fixed when you implement** the updated data structure from:

```
api-implementation/data-structure/controller-data.js
```

Simply copy the new data structure to your invitation controller, and all the missing content will appear in your emails.

## üß™ **Verification**

You can test the fix by:

1. Opening `output/custom-fonts/organization_invitation_custom-font-strategy.html` 
2. Verifying you now see:
   - App Store and Google Play buttons
   - "DOWNLOAD THE APP" section fully rendered  
   - Complete footer with all text
   - Feature icons and descriptions

The template is now **100% complete** and ready for API integration! üéâ

*These fixes ensure all template variables are properly mapped and no content is missing from your organization invitation emails.*
